# Code review material

These directories contain code solutions for problems in practice directories with **slight variations**: subttle errors that are hard to track. Let identify three levels of of slight variations:

1. Errors that are not easily detectable by the average developer, but can be picked up by most powerful ai systems.
2. Errors that are not easily detectable by many SOTA AI systems.
3. Errors that are not detectable by even the most powerful SOTA AI.

Errors, are always considered in conjuction with other errors bc AI can easily miss-out on one in case of another.
