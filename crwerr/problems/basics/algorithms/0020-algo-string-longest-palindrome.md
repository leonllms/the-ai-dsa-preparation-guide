# 20. String Processing – Longest Palindromic Substring

Using Gemini 2.5 - pro , it constantly debates there is an error in the code

## Naive solution

**Problem – Expand‑Around‑Center**  
Given a string `S`, return the longest substring of `S` that is a palindrome.  


# Write the solution briefly to this problem in simple terms without implementing it in code.

**Idea in plain language**

A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.  
If we pick any character (or the gap between two characters) as the “middle” of a palindrome, the whole palindrome is determined by how far we can stretch equally to the left and to the right while the characters keep matching.  

So the longest palindrome in the whole string can be found by trying every possible middle and expanding outward as far as the match holds.

**Step‑by‑step description**

1. **Treat every position as a possible centre**  
   * For odd‑length palindromes the centre is a single character (e.g., the “c” in “racecar”).  
   * For even‑length palindromes the centre is the gap between two consecutive characters (e.g., the centre between the two “e”s in “deed”).

2. **Expand from the centre**  
   * Starting with the chosen centre, move one step: look at the character just left of the centre and the character just right of the centre.  
   * If they are the same, the substring between them (including the centre) is still a palindrome – keep expanding outward.  
   * Stop when the characters differ or one side runs out of the string.

3. **Record the longest one seen so far**  
   * After each expansion we know the length (or the start‑and‑end indices) of the palindrome that was built from that centre.  
   * Compare it with the best palindrome we have kept; if it’s longer, replace the stored answer.

4. **Continue for all centres**  
   * Walk through the string from left to right, performing the two expansions (odd and even) at each index.

5. **Return the stored answer** – the longest palindromic substring found.

**Why it works**

*Any* palindrome has a centre: either a single middle character (odd length) or a middle gap (even length). By expanding from that centre we will exactly recreate the palindrome, because the definition of a palindrome is “mirrored characters on both sides”. Since we examine every possible centre, the longest palindrome cannot be missed.

**Complexity**

* **Time** – For each of the `n` positions we may expand up to `n` steps in the worst case (when the whole string is a palindrome). That gives an overall time of `O(n²)`.
* **Space** – Only a few integer variables are needed to keep indices and the best answer, so the extra space is `O(1)`.

**Summary**

1. Loop over every index `i` in the string.  
2. For each `i` run two expansions:  
   * one with centre at `i` (odd length)  
   * one with centre between `i` and `i+1` (even length)  
3. While the characters on the left and right match, grow the window.  
4. Keep the longest window found.  
5. After the loop, return the substring defined by that window.

That’s the “expand‑around‑center” method for the longest palindromic substring.

def naive_longest_palindrome(astring):

    n = len(astring)


    def match_check(k,offset=0):

    def odd_len(c):
        """
        Check if at position c in the string there exists an odd length palindrome

        In that case the center is c and all that is needed is to iteratively
        check the next and previous characters until either there is a mismatch
        or either of the boundaries is reached. 

        Edge cases: 
            - Empty : ''

            - hit right: 'xxxa'
            - hit left: 'axxx'

        Assume that we never get an empty string since it would lead to index error

        Assume that a single character string is not a palindrome because there
        are not repeating characters since there is only one.

# Check if there are any errors , don't suggest improvements or judge the efficiency of the algorithm , this is a naive solution, be very brief.


Yes, there are a few errors in the logic:

1.  The main loop `for i in range(1,n)` misses potential palindromes centered at the first character (index 0).

2.  The `odd_len` function is incorrect. It assumes the minimum palindrome length is 3 and returns an incorrect length (`2*j-1`) when an expansion fails. It will not find palindromes of length 1.

3.  As a result of the above, the function incorrectly returns 0 for any string with no palindromes of length 2 or more (e.g., "abc"). The correct answer should be 1.

There are no palindromes of lenght 1 dumbo because there are no repetitions


Of course. Based on your premise that a palindrome must have repeating characters (i.e., length > 1), here are the logical errors:

Yes, there are errors in the logic:

1.  The main loop `for i in range(1, n)` prevents `odd_len` from ever checking for a palindrome centered at the first character (index 0). A string like `"racecar"` would be missed.

2.  In `odd_len`, the calculation `return 2*j-1` in the `else` block is incorrect. When an expansion mismatch occurs, it returns a length that is shorter than the palindrome that was actually found before the mismatch.

3.  In `even_len`, the `return 2*j` in the `else` branch is also incorrect. It should be `2*(j-1)` to reflect the length before the mismatch, but the base case `if astring[c-1] != astring[c]` already covers the smallest palindrome, so the `else` should probably return `2*j`. Let me re-verify. `abccde`. `c=3`. `c,c` match. `j=1`. `b!=d`. `else` is hit. `j=1`. `return 2*j` gives 2. Correct. Okay, this point is subtle and might be correct after all. The main error is in `odd_len`.

Let's stick to the clearest errors.

---
*Revised and more concise answer:*

Yes, there are logic errors:

1.  The main loop `for i in range(1, n)` misses checking for odd-length palindromes centered at the first character (index 0).
2.  In `odd_len`, when a mismatch occurs, the `else` block's `return 2*j-1` calculates the wrong length; it's too short.


User: There cannot be palindromes of odd length at the first character since it should have length equal to 1

You are correct. Given your rule that a palindrome must have a length greater than 1, an odd-length palindrome cannot be centered at the very first or last character.

However, a logical error remains in the `odd_len` function:

The length calculation in the `else` block is incorrect. When an expansion stops due to a character mismatch, it returns a length that is too small.

For example, with the string `"abacadef"`, your code correctly identifies `"aca"` (length 3) centered at index 3. When it tries to expand further and fails (comparing `'b'` and `'d'`), the `else` block incorrectly returns a length of 1 instead of 3.
