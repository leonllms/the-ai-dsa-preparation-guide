### How to Use These Exercises

1. **Pick a topic** â€“ start with the area youâ€™re weakest in.  
2. **Write test cases** â€“ create edge cases (empty input, single element, large input, etc.).  
3. **Implement** â€“ code the solution from scratch (no copyâ€‘pasting).  
4. **Analyze** â€“ after youâ€™re done, determine the time and space complexity and compare it with the optimal bound.  
5. **Iterate** â€“ once comfortable, try to improve the solution (e.g., replace a naÃ¯ve \(O(n^2)\) approach with an \(O(n \log n)\) one).
